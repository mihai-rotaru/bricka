Build system for web projects.

Inspired by https://github.com/h5bp/ant-build-script[`ant-build-script`], but
using http://code.google.com/p/waf/[`waf`] instead of `ant`. It is intended to
automate optimization tasks - such as minification and concatenation of css and
JavaScript files, and compression of HTML files.
